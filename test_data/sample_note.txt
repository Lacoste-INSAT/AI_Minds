Meeting Notes - Project Synapsis Planning
Date: February 14, 2026

Attendees: Alice Johnson, Bob Smith, Dr. Carol Lee

Summary:
We discussed the architecture for the Synapsis personal knowledge assistant.
The system will use local-only processing with Ollama for LLM inference and
Qdrant for vector storage. All data stays on the user's machine.

Key Decisions:
1. Use FastAPI as the backend framework for REST and WebSocket APIs.
2. Sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for embeddings — 384 dimensions.
3. SQLite for metadata and graph persistence.
4. NetworkX for in-memory knowledge graph operations.
5. Watchdog for zero-touch file monitoring.

Action Items:
- Alice: Set up the ingestion pipeline by Friday.
- Bob: Implement the hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse + graph) module.
- Carol: Design the proactive insights engine for contradiction detection.

Next meeting: February 21, 2026 at 10:00 AM.
